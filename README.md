# tea_brew_controller
This repo contains the tea brew controller project written in VHDL.<br>
Part of the course "Computer-aided Circuit Design 2".

## Project Structure
- src: directory for all tea_brew_c modules.
- tb: testbenches for those modules.
- docs: specifications for the product written in LaTeX

All simulations and compiles are done in ModelSim.<br>
Synthesis, place and route and programming inside Intel's Quartus Prime Lite.<br>
For hardware the MAX1000 board was used, where the design was flashed on.<br>
